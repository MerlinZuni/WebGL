# Radio audio visualiser
3D environment with WebGL plus some audio visualisation. 

For this project, I created a 3D logo that reacts to audio input. The logo dances and acts as an audio visualiser.

## Technologies used:
https://p5js.org/
This project uses the p5.js WebGL library to create a 3D enviornment in the web browser.

I'm also using the p5.sound library

https://www.blender.org/
I've illustrated the liip AG company logo using blender to create an .obj file.

## Audio
I'm using an .mp3 file as a test.
My ultimate goal is to link our https://radio.liip.ch/ stream as the audio source.
